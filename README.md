# DGC Style Guide

## Jekyll & Github Pages
This styleguide uses (https://jekyllrb.com) as the templating engine so the styleguide can be hosted on GitHub Pages (https://pages.github.com/).

## CSS Preprocessor - SASS
Please refer to https://sass-lang.com/

## Task Runner - Gulp
Please refer to https://gulpjs.com/

## Development Workflow
### SASS - Structure of Style Guide
sass --watch styleguide/css/sass/structure.scss:styleguide/css/structure.css

## Code Editor
If you are using VS Code, I recommend installing vscode-prettydiff (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HexcodeTechnologies.vscode-prettydiff) to help with Jekyll in your html pages.
